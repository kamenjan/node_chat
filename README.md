This is authenticated asynchronous chat application built on top of node.js. 

I used express.js framework but did not go full MEAN. Instead of mongoDB, this
applications data is powered by postgresql. I still haven't decided on
front-end framework.

Application architecture loosely follows MVC pattern. Routes are controllers,
I've added models for database interactions with great deal of application 
logic and default express.js views.

Application structure also includes custom middleware, helpers and 
configuration.

I wanted to learn node.js for some time now and I think this project is a 
perfect fit for set task.
